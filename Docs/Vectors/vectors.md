# Vectors in R

In R, a vector is a one-dimensional array that can store homogeneous data (i.e., data of the same type). Vectors are one of the fundamental data structures in R and are used to store a sequence of values, such as numbers or characters.

To create a vector in R, you can use the `c()` function, which stands for concatenate. You can pass any number of comma-separated values to this function to create a vector. Here's an example:
```r
# create a numeric vector
my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# create a character vector
my_other_vector <- c("apple", "banana", "orange")
```
