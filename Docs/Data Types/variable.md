# Variables in R

A variable is a named container that can store a value or an object in R. The value or object can be accessed using the variable's name.

## Assigning values to variables

To assign a value to a variable in R, we use the assignment operator `<-` or `=`. For example:

```r
# using the assignment operator
x <- 5

# using the equals sign
y = 10

```

## Naming variables
In R, variable names must start with a letter or a dot (.), followed by any combination of letters, digits, and dots. Variable names are case sensitive.

```R
# valid variable names
a <- 5
my.var <- 10
.MyVariable <- 15

# invalid variable names
3var <- 5
my-var <- 10
