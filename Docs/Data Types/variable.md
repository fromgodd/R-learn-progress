# Variable Assignment

A basic concept in (statistical) programming is called a variable

A variable allows you to store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g a function description) in R. You can then later use this variable to easily access the value of the object that is stored within this variable. You can assign a value 4 to a variable `my_var` with the command

`my_var <- 4`
